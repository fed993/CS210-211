\f0\fs24 \cf0 The red-black tree is better in this case, as in the worst case, you\'92d need to traverse 6 nodes to \'93search\'94 for 6 in the normal binary search tree, but only 3 nodes for 6 in the red black tree. The red black tree is more balanced overall, and so as a result ALL values are reachable within 3 traversals. The Red-Black tree guarantees balance like this, whereas the standard binary search tree does not.}
